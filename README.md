Toggle JavaScript Chrome extension
==================================

This is the source code for the "JS Toggle" extension for Google Chrome or
Chromium browsers.

The official built extension can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.

If you find any of this source code useful, awesome! Tell your friends about the
extension and help me out by giving it a positive review at the Chrome Web Store.

Description
-----------

Toggle JavaScript provides a simple, easy-to-access browser button to enable
or disable JavaScript globally. Obviously Chrome allows you to do this, but
the setting is a pain to access if you are a developer using it often.

### Features:

- global JavaScript master switch
- reloads pages reliably when disabling JavaScript

### More Info:

I found similar extensions that enable or disable JavaScript per-domain,
but I found that this over-complicates things a bit so I decided to build
this JavaScript "master switch".

Also, similar extensions can cause pages to be rendered incorrectly when they
are automatically reloaded after disabling JavaScript. I have found a way
around this so that pages will reload reliably.

I hope you enjoy using it - if you do, please tell your friends about it
and help me out by giving it a positive review. Thanks!
