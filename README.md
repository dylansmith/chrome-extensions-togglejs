ToggleJS Chrome extension
=========================

This is the source code for the "JS Toggle" extension for Google Chrome or
Chromium browsers.

The official built extension can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.

If you find any of this source code useful, awesome! Tell your friends about the
extension and help me out by giving it a positive review at the Chrome Web Store.

Description
-----------

ToggleJS provides a simple, easy-to-access browser button to enable or disable JavaScript
globally. Other similar extensions disable or enable JavaScript per-domain, but I found that
this over-complicates things a bit so I decided to build my own JavaScript "master switch"
that was easy to use.

I've also seen that other similar extensions can cause the page to be rendered incorrectly
when they reload the page after disabling JavaScript. I have found a way around this so that
the page will reload reliably.

I hope you enjoy using it - if you do, please tell your friends about it and help me out by
giving it a positive review. Thanks!
